  <p>Welcome to Islam Hub! We are a international and upcoming organisation that provides dozens of online Islamic services, lots of advice and much more. We are still working to make our website better and in the future we may create an app for Android and Apple.</p>

  <h1><a href="/archives/">Archives</a><</h1>
    <p>The <a href="/archive-project.html">archives project</a> is a project to archive hundreds of Islamic websites, resources, software and other things. We host them on SSG (Static Site Generator) using github.io.</p>
    <p>If you would like to contribute to this project, you can contact us and join the Islam Hub Labs team which is responsible for development and content creation. Additionally, you can join the S.A.B. (Scholarly Advisory Board) which will help us filter, edit, polish and re-publish archived content so that it is up to date or correct.</p>
    <p>Websites that are archived and have content that we do not, have services we do not, may have them integrated into the main site and available.</p>
